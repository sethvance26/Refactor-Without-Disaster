# Refactor Without Disaster

## Task At Hand

This week, we were tasked with refactoring and modifying existing code without changing the functionality of the overall webpage.

First and foremost, there were too many duplicate classes within the CSS style sheet. 
I removed some of these duplicate classes and combined them together into one.

After consolidating some of the duplicate CSS classes, I had to make sure to re-name those same classes within the HTML document.

Next, we created some space between lines of code on both the HTML and CSS style sheet to make the code easier to interpret. 

To ensure that the links still functioned correctly, I made sure that the ID's matched up within the </a href/> tag, as well as the div classes.
